Generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer (debug build).
 Generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer. 
 
 Uses gthreads coroutine, fat chance of this being broken.
 More info on the debug (help wanted/FIXME/TODO):
 - sigaltstack is broken on iOS (rdar://13002712)- we can't use it without major hacking.
 - Custom write GNU PTH's (pth_mctx.c) example of editing jmp_buf's return address for user threads; Darwin 18 now messes with fp (jmp_buf + 80), lr (jmp_buf + 88), and sp (jmp_buf + 96), preventing this (tldr: figure how to reverse ptr_mange to change return address at longjmp).
 - TCI is too slow / crashes (help welcomed on debugging).
